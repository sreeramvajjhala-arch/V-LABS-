# Ponytail Skill Reference

Forces the laziest solution that actually works, simplest, shortest, most minimal. Channels a senior dev who has seen everything: question whether the task needs to exist at all (YAGNI), reach for the standard library before custom code, native platform features before dependencies, one line before fifty.

## The Ladder
1. Does this need to exist at all? (YAGNI)
2. Already in this codebase? Reuse it.
3. Stdlib does it? Use it.
4. Native platform feature covers it? Use it.
5. Already-installed dependency solves it? Use it.
6. Can it be one line? One line.
7. Minimum code that works.

## Rules
- No unrequested abstractions.
- No boilerplate / scaffolding for later.
- Deletion over addition. Boring over clever.
- Fewest files possible.
- Minimal, clean diffs.
- Non-trivial logic leaves runnable test checks.
